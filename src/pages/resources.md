# Tracts

Powerful Gospel Tracts are indispensable! Christians spend millions annually on books that will help them in their own personal lives, but few spend anything significant for literature they will distribute. The assembly is actively involved in the gospel tracts ministry and is the epicentre for the development and production of gospel tracts in Fiji. The tracts are distributed in: hospitals, health centres, educational institutions, cultural festivals, homes; and to tourists on cruise ships. The tracts have also been sent to assemblies planted in other Pacific Island Countries including Nauru, Tuvalu, Tonga and the Solomon Islands.

All our tracts may be downloaded and distributed anywhere in the world. We invite you to pray for this vital ministry of the assembly.
