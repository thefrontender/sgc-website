# Who we are

We understand ourselves to be part of the true universal Church -  a spiritual entity composed of all individuals who put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

We are a group of Christians from various nationalities and walks of life. Our assembly’s  unique character comes from its members, the Lord’s people who come together at Samabula Gospel Chapel.

What unifies us is the fundamental belief in the teaching of the Bible as the Word of God.  We try to live by its instruction and come together based on the example of the New Testament assemblies.

Our weekly gatherings are for the purposes of:

1. Fellowship as defined by remembering Christ’s finished work for our salvation in the Lord’s Supper and Prayer
2. Worship
3. Teaching
4. Evangelism

We offer a safe and welcoming nursery environment for babies and toddlers during services, and at the majority of other church functions.

Every member has opportunity to participate in the assembly by serving others with the unique gift(s) God has given them.

Our leader is the Lord Jesus Christ.

We are autonomous as an assembly and non-denominational in our outlook.

We strive to connect with one another. The Lord Jesus called His disciples to be in community with him as He travelled His life journey. We, too, seek companionship as we travel both our spiritual and life journeys. We recognise the need for connectivity, and we are working to develop many opportunities to connect one to another.
