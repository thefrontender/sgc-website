Ladies visited one of our longstanding chapel members who have moved back to their village after retiring from working faithfully in the brethren school for decades. The Samabula Gopele ladies were received by Brother Waqa and Sister Alowesi and their daughter Ulamila. It was a wonderful time of fellowship and a time to encourage each other in the Lord and he works amongst the Logani villagers.
