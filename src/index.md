We are a group of Christians from various nationalities and walks of life. Our assembly’s unique character comes from its members, the Lord’s people who come together at Samabula Gospel Chapel.

Our Sunday fellowship meets at *28 Belo Street in Samabula* for:

* Sunday school from 9:00 to 9:45am
* Sunday worship from 10:00 to 11:30am

We offer a safe and welcoming nursery environment for babies and toddlers during services, and at the majority of other church functions.
